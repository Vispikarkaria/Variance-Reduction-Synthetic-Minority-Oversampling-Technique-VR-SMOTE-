VR-SMOTE Implementation
This repository contains the Python implementation of the Variance Reduction Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (VR-SMOTE), a novel approach to handling data imbalance in machine learning datasets. The technique is particularly suited for datasets where the minority class is under-represented, and traditional over-sampling methods like SMOTE may lead to overfitting.

Overview
VR-SMOTE addresses the shortcomings of the traditional SMOTE algorithm by first clustering the minority class samples using K-Nearest Neighbors and then selectively applying SMOTE to clusters with medium and high variance. This ensures that synthetic samples are only generated where necessary, thus preventing overfitting and enhancing model generalization.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Python 3.6 or above.
You have installed the necessary Python packages found in requirements.txt.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/vr-smote.git
cd vr-smote
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
The main logic of the VR-SMOTE method is encapsulated in the vr_smote.py script. To apply VR-SMOTE to your dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in a CSV format where the last column represents the class labels.
Load your dataset into a Python script or a Jupyter notebook.
Import and invoke the VR-SMOTE function:
python
Copy code
from vr_smote import vr_smote

# Assume `data` is your loaded dataset
balanced_data = vr_smote(data)
Use the balanced_data for training your machine learning models.
